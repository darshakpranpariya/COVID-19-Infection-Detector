# COVID-19-Infection-Detector

I have trained CNN using images of patient's chest-xray whom are infected by coronavirus. This neural network can predict that patient is infected by coronavirus or not by using only patient's xray of chest.

DISCLAIMER:-

Accuracy of this neural net is not 100%. it's only trained through 170 samples of infected people.Moreover, it's mainly made for educational purpose so please don't totally depend on it.
